\section{Overview}

Some notes on the key constructions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Categories of families, special case of Grothendieck construction
\end{itemize}

\noindent $\Set$ will often be $\Setoid$ in the Agda code but I'm glossing that here.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Indexed families of objects}

For any set $I$ and category $C$ write $\Fam(I,C)$ for the category where:
\begin{itemize}
\item the objects are the $I$-indexed families of objects of $C$;
\item a morphism from $X$ to $Y$ is a family of morphisms $f_i: X_i \to Y_i$ in $C$ for any $i \in I$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Equivalently, $\Fam(I,C)$ is the functor category $\Functors{I}{C}$.

\noindent Suppose $x \in \Fam(I,C)$ and $y \in \Fam(J,C)$. Define $y_f$ for any $f: I \to J$ to be the
$I$-indexed family of objects of $C$.

\subsection{Category of families}

For a functor $F: C \to Set$, we have the category where:
\begin{itemize}
\item objects are pairs $(I, x)$ with $I$ an object of $C$ and $x \in FI$
\item morphisms from $(I, x)$ to $(J, y)$ are morphisms $f: I \to J$ in $C$ where $(Ff)(x) = y$
\end{itemize}

\noindent This is the Grothendieck construction for a functor $F: C \to \Cat$, in the special case where $F: C
\to \Set$. (Where we read a $\Set$-valued functor as a $\Cat$-valued functor restricted to discrete
categories.)

In our code we give a slightly different construction. For a category $C$, define the category where:
\begin{itemize}
\item objects are pairs $(I, x)$ with $I$ a set and $x$ an $I$-indexed family of objects of $C$
\item morphisms from $(I, x)$ to $(J, y)$ are functions $f: I \to J$ paired with morphisms
\end{itemize}
