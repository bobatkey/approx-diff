\subsection{Predicate systems}
\label{sec:predicate-system}

A \emph{predicate system} over a category $\cat{C}$ with products is a functor $\Pred: \cat{C}^\op \to \Set$

A preorder on predicates (_⊑_).

Reindexing [f] (pullback) and [f⟩ (pushforward or existential image) that satisfy an adjunction.

Logical connectives (&&, ++, ==>, TT) and quantification (⋀).

These operations satisfy standard laws such as monotonicity, closure under reindexing, etc.
