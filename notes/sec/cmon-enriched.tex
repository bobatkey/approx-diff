\subsection{$\CMon$-enriched categories}
\label{sec:cmon-enriched}

\begin{definition}[Commutative monoid]
A \emph{commutative monoid} $A = (A, \varepsilon, \bullet)$ is a set $A$ equipped with distinguished element
$\varepsilon \in A$ called the \emph{unit} and associative binary operation $\bullet$ satisfying $\varepsilon
\bullet x = x$ and $x \bullet \varepsilon = x$ for any $x \in A$.
\end{definition}

A commutative monoid homomorphism from $A$ to $B$ is any function $f: A \to B$ preserving $\varepsilon$ and
$\bullet$.

\begin{definition}[Category of commutative monoids]
Define $\CMon$ to be the category whose objects are the commutative monoids $A$ and morphisms $A \to B$ are
the commutative monoid homomorphisms.
\end{definition}

$\CMon$ is symmetric closed monoidal, with the trivial one-element monoid $\One$ as terminal object, monoidal
product $A \tensor B$ given by the direct product of $A$ and $B$, and braiding given by the isomorphism $A
\times B \iso B \times A$. $\CMon$ is complete and cocomplete, inheriting all limits and colimits from $\Set$.

\subsubsection{$\CMon$-enriched categories}

We note that if a category $C$ is $\CMon$-enriched, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every hom-object $\Hom{C}{A}{B}$ is a commutative monoid of morphisms; we write $\zero_{A,B}$ (zero
morphism) for the unit, and $+_{A,B}$ (addition of morphisms) for the binary operation.
\item Composition is \emph{biadditive}, i.e.~given by a family of morphisms $\Hom{C}{B}{C} \tensor
\Hom{C}{A}{B} \to \Hom{C}{A}{C}$ in $\CMon$ that preserve the additive structure in $\Hom{C}{B}{C}$ and
$\Hom{C}{A}{B}$ separately:

\begin{salign*}
f \comp \zero = f = \zero \comp f
\end{salign*}
\begin{salign*}
(f + g) \comp h &= (f \comp h) + (g \comp h) \\
h \comp (f + g) &= (h \comp f) + (h \comp g)
\end{salign*}
\end{enumerate}

$\CMon$ is closed monoidal, and so enriched over itself. More specifically every hom-object $\CMon(A,B)$ is a
commutative monoid of commutative monoid homomorphisms where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the unit $0$ is the constant homomorphism sending every element of $A$ to $\varepsilon_B$;
\item addition of morphisms $+$ is defined pointwise so that $(f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proposition}
If $C$ is $\CMon$-enriched then for any category $D$ the functor category $\Func{D}{C}$ is $\CMon$-enriched.
\end{proposition}
