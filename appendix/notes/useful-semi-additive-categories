\subsubsection{Category of bounded lattices and Galois connections}
\label{sec:categories-with-biproducts:latgal}

\begin{definition}[Bounded lattice]
A \emph{bounded lattice} $X = (X, \top, \meet, \bot, \join)$ is a set $X$ equipped with binary operations
$\meet$ and $\join$ and distinguished elements $\top$ and $\bot$ such that $(X, \top, \meet)$ is a bounded
meet-semilattice and $(X, \bot, \join)$ is a bounded join-semilattice
(\defref{cmon-enriched:bounded-semilattice}), and the two semilattices induce the same partial order on $X$,
i.e.~$x \le_{\meet} y \iff x \le_{\join} y$.
\end{definition}

\noindent Equivalently, $(X, \top, \meet, \bot, \join)$ is a bounded lattice iff $(X, \top, \meet)$ and $(X,
\bot, \join)$ are commutative monoids satisfying \emph{absorption} laws:

\begin{itemize}
\item $x \join (x \meet y) = x$
\item $x \meet (x \join y) = x$
\end{itemize}

\noindent from which the idempotence of $\meet$ and $\join$ and equivalence of $\le_{\meet}$ and $\le_{\join}$
then follow.

\begin{definition}[Galois connection]
Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are posets. A \emph{Galois connection} $f \adj g: X$ to $Y$ is a pair of monotone
functions $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ satisfying $y \leq f(x) \iff g(y) \leq x$ for any $x \in X$ and $y \in
Y$.
\end{definition}

\noindent The notation is justified because a Galois connection $f \adj g: X \to Y$ is an adjunction between
poset categories, with monotone $f$ and $g$ interpreted as functors; $f$ is usually referred to as the
\emph{upper} (right) adjoint and $g$ as the \emph{lower} (left) adjoint. Galois connections compose
component-wise, with $\id_X \adj \id_X: X \to X$ as the unit for composition. Thus we can define the following
category.

\begin{definition}[Category $\LatGal$]
Define the category $\LatGal$ which has:
\begin{itemize}
\item as objects $X, Y$ all bounded lattices;
\item as morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ all Galois connections $f \adj g: X \to Y$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\noindent Right adjoints preserves limits and left adjoints preserves colimits, so for any $f \adj g: X \to Y$
in $\LatGal$, $f$ and $g$ preserves the meet-semilattice structure of $X$ and join-semilattice structure of
$Y$ respectively. Moreover since $(X, \top, \meet)$ is a commutative monoid, and thus a $\CMon$-enriched poset
category, for any $X, Y$ there is a zero meet-semilattice homomorphism $0^{\meet}_{X,Y}: X \to Y =
\const(\top_Y)$ and also (idempotent) addition of homomorphisms $f +_{\meet} g: X \to Y$ given by pointwise
application of $\meet$. Dually, there is a zero join-semilattice homomorphism $0^{\join}_{X,Y}: X \to Y =
\const(\bot_Y)$ and idempotent addition of homomorphisms $f +_{\join} g: X \to Y$ again given pointwise by
$\join$. Thus $\LatGal$ is itself $\CMon$-enriched (in fact $\SemiLat$-enriched), with the hom object
$\LatGal(X,Y)$ forming a bounded semilattice with:
\begin{itemize}
\item zero morphism $0_{X,Y}$ given by the Galois connection $\const(\top_Y) \adj \const(\bot_X): X \to Y$
\item component-wise idempotent addition of morphisms $(f \adj g) + (f' \adj g') = (f +_{\meet} f') \adj (g
+_{\join} g'): X \to Y$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent and biadditivity of composition also arising component-wise. Moreover the projections from the
product lattice $\pi_1: X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_2: X \times Y \to Y$ have both upper and lower adjoints,
and in fact $\LatGal$ has finite biproducts, with the trivial 1-point lattice as zero object and binary
biproducts $(X \biprod Y, \biinj_X, \biinj_Y, \biproj_X, \biproj_Y)$, where $X \biprod Y$ is the product
lattice $X \times Y$ and:

\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
   \biproj_X: X \biprod Y \to X = \proj_1 \adj \prodM{\id_X}{\const(\bot_Y)} \\
   \biproj_Y: X \biprod Y \to Y = \proj_2 \adj \prodM{\const(\bot_X)}{\id_Y}
\end{align*}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
   \biinj_X: X \to X \biprod Y = \prodM{\id_X}{\const(\top_Y)} \adj \pi_1 \\
   \biinj_Y: Y \to X \biprod Y = \prodM{\const(\top_X)}{\id_Y} \adj \pi_2
\end{align*}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{2mm}

\noindent with product and coproduct of Galois connections computed component-wise.

\subsubsection{Category of finite-dimensional vector spaces}
\label{sec:categories-with-biproducts:fdvect}

\begin{definition}[Vector space over a field]
Suppose $F = (F, +, \mult)$ a field with addition of elements $a, b$ written $a + b$ and multiplication
written $a \mult b$. Then a \emph{vector space $V = (V, +, \mult)$ over $F$} (overloading $+$ and $\mult$) is
a set $V$ equipped with addition of vectors $+: V^2 \to V$ and scalar multiplication $\mult: F \times V \to V$
where $(V,+)$ is an abelian group (with identity element $0_V$ and additive inverse $-v$ for any $v \in V$)
and the vector operations are compatible with the field operations in that the following equations hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \mult v = v$
\item $(a \mult b) \mult v = a \mult (b \mult v)$
\item $(a + b) \mult v = (a \mult v) + (b \mult v)$
\item $a \mult (u + v) = (a \mult u) + (b \mult v)$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Up to isomorphism a finite-dimensional vector space over $F$ of dimension $n \in \Nat$ is the vector space
$(F^n, +, \mult)$ where $+$ and $\mult$ are defined component-wise.

\begin{definition}[Category $\FinVect_F$]
Define $\FinVect_F$ to be the category where:
\begin{itemize}
\item objects $V, W$ are natural numbers $n$ paired with an $n$-dimensional vector space $(F^n, +, \mult)$
\item morphisms $f: V \to W$ are functions $f$ satisfying $f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v)$ and $f(a \mult v) = a \mult f(v)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

$\FinVect_F$ is $\Ab$-enriched (and therefore $\CMon$-enriched). For any $V, W$ we have that $\FinVect_F(V,W)$
is an abelian group, where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0_{V,W}(v) = 0_W$
\item $(f + g)(v) = f(v) + g(v)$
\item $(-f)(v) = -f(v)$
\end{enumerate}
\noindent with composition bilinear by (2) and component-wise addition of morphisms. The direct sum $V \biprod
W = (V \times W, +, \mult)$, with $+$ and $\mult$ defined componenent-wise, is a biproduct $(V \biprod W,
\biinj_V, \biinj_W, \pi_1, \pi_2)$ with $\biinj_V = \prodM{\id_V}{0_{V,W}}$ and $\biinj_W =
\prodM{0_{V,W}}{\id_W}$.
