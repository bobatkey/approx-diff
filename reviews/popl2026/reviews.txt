Paper summary
-------------
This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework that unifies Galois slicing (a program slicing technique) with automatic differentiation (AD) through categorical semantics. By leveraging the CHAD (Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation) framework and stable domain theory, the authors formalize Galois slicing as a form of AD, where forward and backward slices correspond to forward/backward derivatives. The paper establishes a categorical model, proves the correctness of higher-order interpretations via Grothendieck logical relations, and demonstrates cross-language extensibility through a higher-order functional language with type systems and operational semantics. Key contributions include the theoretical re-foundation of program slicing via AD analogies and practical case studies.

Comments for authors
--------------------
### Favorite Points

- The analogy between Galois connections and differential mappings is very interesting. It bridges program analysis with well-established AD theory, offering a fresh perspective on slicing.

- The use of CHAD and Grothendieck logical relations provides a mathematically robust foundation for verifying slicing correctness.

- The high-order language design validates the framework’s adaptability to diverse languages, enhancing practical relevance.

- It is nice to see the linkage between stable functions (from domain theory) and smooth functions (from differential geometry).

### Weak Points

- While the introduction is accessible, the subsequent sections are highly technical and challenging for non-experts to follow. Key intuitions are often obscured by dense formalism.

- The paper lacks empirical validation or comparisons with existing slicing tools, making it difficult to assess real-world applicability.

- The paper focuses on "total functions" but does not address partiality or recursion in slicing correctness proofs, which are critical for real-world programs.

Specific questions to be addressed in the author response
---------------------------------------------------------
Q1. Could the authors provide a high-level "roadmap" linking each theoretical component (e.g., Galois connection, CHAD) to its slicing/AD counterpart? This would improve accessibility.

Q2. Is there any plan to implement this framework in a practical AD tool and compare slicing accuracy/performance with baseline methods?

## CONTENTS

This paper discusses Galois slicing, a notion introduced by Perera et al, for tracking approximations of the input and the output and points to an analogy with forward and backward derivatives in differentiable programming.

After the introduction (Section 1), Section 2 develops an analogy between Berry’s notion of stability in denotational semantics and the notion of smoothness in calculus. The section reviews existing results, discusses the analogy informally, and culminates in a conjecture (Conjecture 2.15, line 498), which is intended to serve as the true witness of this analogy.

Section 3 then turns to the free coproduct completion $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathcal{C})$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ (Def. 3.1, lines 524 and 573) and examines its application to specific categories: the category $\mathbf{LatGal}$ of bounded lattices and Galois connections, and the two categories of semilattices, $\mathbf{MeetSLat}$ and $\mathbf{JoinSLat}$ (lines 549–559).
In particular, drawing on a result of Lucatelli Nunes et al. (Thm. 3.6, line 602), the authors establish that $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{MeetSLat})$ is cartesian closed (Cor. 3.7, line 614), as is $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{MeetSLat} \times \mathbf{JoinSLat}^{op})$ (Cor. 3.13).

Unfortunately, this result does not extend to $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$, since the latter category lacks infinite products. However, there exists a faithful functor H from $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$ to $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{MeetSLat} \times \mathbf{JoinSLat}^{op})$ which will be used to define a semantics in $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$ for functional programs with first-order types, drawing on results of Fiore and Simpson (Thm. 5.1, line 1042, and Thm. 5.2, line 1057).

Section 4 reviews the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus with products and coproducts, extended with the list constructor and the fold combinator, together with its standard categorical interpretation (Figure 3). Section 5 then shows how to recover, from $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{MeetSLat} \times \mathbf{JoinSLat}^{op})$, a denotation of first-order terms into $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$.


## OVERALL EVALUATION

### Strengths

1. The paper establishes a nontrivial result, showing how a category of Galois connections $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$ can be used to provide denotations of first-order functional programs, even though the category is not (known to be?) cartesian closed.

2. It offers several intriguing indications of analogies with recent work in differentiable programming, such as CHAD and differential reverse categories.

3. It proposes an interesting conjecture (Conjecture 2.15), aiming to relate Berry’s notion of stability to smoothness in analysis.

4. Many of the results have been formalised in Agda, with the corresponding code made available in the supplementary material (though the present reviewer did not have the opportunity to verify it).

### Weaknesses

1. The paper is rather dispersive, with many digressions and asides, which makes it difficult for the reader to keep track of the main goal. As far as I understand, the core new contribution is the use of the free coproduct completion of a category of Galois connections to provide denotations of first-order simply typed terms, even though the category is not (known to be?)  cartesian closed.

2. The title and abstract of the paper are misleading, as both refer to automatic differentiation.
This is a technique based on program transformation (and/or operator overloading) for computing derivatives, Jacobians, etc., of numerical programs, by exploiting their syntactical structure.
The paper, however, does not address such transformations.
Instead, it draws (informal) analogies between the categorical structures of $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{MeetSLat} \times \mathbf{JoinSLat}^{op})$ and those in CHAD and reverse differential categories, without presenting precise technical results in this direction. This is a good point but I would not present it as the major contribution of the paper.

3. The programming language considered is standard, and the core technical result of the paper is giving a denotational models based on Galois connections. While this result is both interesting and novel, it is also rather technical. I do not see how such a contribution shows that Galois slicing is a "generalised form of automatic differentiation". I would rather say that this contribution is an application of a known categorical construction to build a denotational model of a standard programming language. The paper might therefore be better suited to a more domain-specific conference.

4. One of the main digressions appears in Section 2, where an analogy between Berry’s stability and smoothness is discussed.
This is an appealing intuition, and I was enthusiastic to read this part.
Unfortunately, the discussion remains purely informal, culminating only in a conjecture as a technical counterpart.
Moreover, this analogy is not new: it is for example the starting point for differential linear logic, where the trace of a stable function is expressed via a Taylor expansion (see Ehrhard, *An introduction to differential linear logic: proof-nets, models and antiderivatives*, MSCS 2018).
Even more strikingly, Crubillé has established a precise result (*Probabilistic Stable Functions on Discrete Cones are Power Series*, LICS 2018), showing that in the category of probabilistic coherence spaces, stable functions correspond exactly to smooth functions over positive, discrete cones.
I regret that the submitted paper does not discuss the existing literature. I understand, however, that this body of work has grown rapidly in recent years, making it difficult to have a complete picture.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I believe that, both in terms of presentation and content, this paper does not meet the standards required for a large-venue conference.

Specific questions to be addressed in the author response
---------------------------------------------------------
- The paper mentions that we cannot prove that $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$ is cartesian closed using Theorem 3.6, as this category does not have infinite products.
Do we have any counterexamples showing that $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathbf{LatGal})$ is not cartesian closed, or is it simply unknown whether it is CCC?

- Line 410 cites Taylor [1999] for a characterization of stability in terms of Galois connections. However, this is a book of more than 600 pages.
Could a more precise reference (chapter, section, or page) be provided?

Paper summary
-------------
This submission presents a semantic framework that reinterprets \emph{Galois slicing} (a program slicing technique based on Galois connections) as an \emph{AD-style} program transformation. The central idea is the instantiating of the existing CHAD framework to obtain a categorical semantics in which slices of program values play the role of derivatives or tangent values.

Comments for authors
--------------------
The paper is clearly written, and the application of CHAD in this setting is commendable. However, the contribution remains largely interpretative. Leveraging CHAD to obtain a new instance of program transformation is conceptually natural and not, in itself, theoretically novel. The core categorical construction is imported from CHAD. Most of the other key properties were already known in the literature.

On the practical side, the evaluation could benefit from examples going beyond toy examples, with some substantive case studies or applications to substantial/relevant programs. The work would be considerably strengthened by a clearer articulation of its motivation and by demonstrating compelling use-cases, case studies, or implementations in (almost) realistic settings.

Specific questions to be addressed in the author response
---------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{1}
That is a natural question, but could already have been addressed in the paper: Could the setting be extended into a source-to-source transformation, generating code that computes slices alongside normal evaluation?



 \textbf{2}
  The paper hints at ``quantitative slicing'' (intervals, graded provenance). Could the authors provide more end-to-end examples where such richer approximations yield insight unavailable in classical Galois slicing? Could the authors explain better how this approach compares to existing provenance mechanisms?

\textbf{3}
 I am not sure this was treated exhaustively, but could the authors tell us more about what the computational overhead is of carrying slices alongside values?

\textbf{4}
Could the authors say more on how the framework compare, qualitatively or quantitatively, with existing slicing/provenance techniques in such domains?

\textbf{5}
I wonder if the work on partiality and CHAD helps in your setting?
