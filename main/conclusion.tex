\paragraph{Integrating XAI techniques with Galois slicing.} \roly{Sketch what this might look like.}
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)~\cite{selvaraju20}
use reverse-mode AD selectively on specific activations, calculating \emph{heat maps} that highlight input
regions contributing to a given classification decision. It might be possible to compose these techniques with
\GPS whilst still preserving useful round-tripping properties; if so this could be a basis for end-to-end
explainability in systems that combine neural networks with traditional symbolic computation.
